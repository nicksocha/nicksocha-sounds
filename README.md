#### [sounds.NickSocha.com](https://sounds.NickSocha.com) is a fun Soundboard site I threw together.

The idea came from [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego) from Wes Bos' [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course. Check out the code as well on [GitHub](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit).
